    "1. [Abstraction](#Abstraction)\n",
    "2. [Encapsulation](#Abstraction)\n",
    "3. [Combining Data and Behavior](#Combining-Data-and-Behavior)\n",
    "4. [Sharing](#Sharing)\n",
    "5. [Emphasis on The Essence of an Object](#Emphasis-on-The-Essence-of-an-Object)\n",
    "6. [Synergy](#Synergy)\n",
