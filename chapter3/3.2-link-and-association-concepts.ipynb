    "### Links and Assocations\n",
    "A *link* is the direct connection among objects. For example, in the previous section `plato` is **AdvisedBy** by `socrates` which is a direct link between two objects. Additionally the `advisor` attribute is called a *reference* as it makes reference to another object.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *association* is a group of links with common structure and semantics. This typically means the generic relation between two or more classes. On a class level, a `Student` instance is always **AdvisedBy** a `Teacher` instance."

    "<br>\n",
    "For example, the `Student`/`Teacher` association of **AdvisedBy** has a one-to-many multiplicity. Each `Student` can only have 1 advisor while a `Teacher` may advise several `Student`s. This is called a *one-to-many* association. Now lets use the `Course` class to create a `many-to-many` association.\n",

    "NOTE: The name **AdvisedBy** is purely for diagrams (isn't seen in the code and camel case is standard). For now the walk-through doesn't show diagrams alongside the code but it's good to have in mind how/why each reference is made."
